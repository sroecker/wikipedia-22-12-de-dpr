# Wikipedia 22-12 DE DPR

The aim of this project is to provide a German dataset for the training of DPR models.
This way German document retriever models can be trained.

The source of our data is the [German Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/)
or, to be more precise, the data set
[Cohere/wikipedia-22-12-de-embeddings](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cohere/wikipedia-22-12-de-embeddings)
from [Cohere](https://cohere.com/).
